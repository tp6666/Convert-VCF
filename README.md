A PowerShell script to read a VCF file and output its data to a CSV file or preview the data using PowerShell's GridView.
It should work for VCF Format Version 1.x to 3.x, but I've only tested it against the Test.vcf file that has examples of VCF Version 3 data.

Original code from https://github.com/dmarkle/ConvertFrom-Vcf:- this repo has pending updates and apears to have ceased development.
Code has been updated to cover more versions of VCF formats and more phone, email and address types.
Also added comments in the code, because I'm old school and understand not everyone is a programmer.
A little explanation can be very helpful when working with any programming language, especially PowerShell.
